Seems like an easy process to find an honest limo company but I was amazed by how many shay limo companies there are out there, many with legitimate looking websites. Every time I thought I found a good company I’d yelp them and they had miserable reviews. Thankfully while I was researching on yelp I came across Masterpiece Limo. We talked to Eddie, had Phil as a driver, and had an outstanding day wine tasting in Temecula. The limo was clean, on time and very professional. Phil’s service was great and he even left his personal cell number for us when we forgot something in the limo to get it back to us. I can’t say enough good things about them. I would recommend this company to anyone looking for a limo. You’ll love it.”",

A couple of months ago was my Hubby’s birthday. After negotiating with Geoff at Limo Kings he contacted Eddie about renting with him since Geoff was unable to reserve the size limo we needed that night. Eddie honored our price and even gave us a Yelp discount. It was hands down the best service we could ever excepted. The day of the event, Eddie called me to confirm. He verified our address and even gave me the contact information of the driver. At 5:45 pm, I received a call from Bill (the driver) that he was right outside our door. We barely had time to finish our pre-party before we all hopped into the limo. First stop downtown, our driver Bill made sure that he opened the car door for us at every stop. This ensured that we did not get injured or walk into traffic. Bill was very professional and accommodating. He knew exactly how to get to every location and was kind enough to refill our ice supply during the evening. During certain points in the evening one of our guests needed to go back downtown to retrieve his car and Bill was more than willing to drop our friend off while we were inside the karaoke bar. We had a great night!!! Thank you so much Bill and Eddie!!!”",

I relied on yelp to help me make most of my decisions and as far as limos go, MASTERPIECE LIMOUSINE was a GREAT choice for my event!! This was my first ever wine tour and I was clueless with everything. So like I said I did tons of research and finally called Masterpiece to book my limo, but first I wanted to check the fleets out, which was not a problem for Eddie. At the end of the day, I decided on the Hummer Limo because I wanted to go BIG for my best friends! I called Eddie to book it and he was just so HELPFUL. I told him it was my first time doing all this so I asked him what his favorite wineries were, I chose 1 of the 3 he recommended because I already had a list of my own, but I did choose his favorite, which was FUN! He also called the wineries for me to let them know we would be there, so I didn’t really do anything, but call Eddie. hah! Anyways, the day of the event Eddie upgraded us to a LIMO BUS because he didn’t want us to take the hummer limo due to battery problems. I was hesitant at first because it was a small group of people and I was thinking party bus. I decided to take up on his offer which was the best decision I made because it wasn’t too small/big it was perfect at the end of the day. The bus was stocked with sodas, ice, glasses, and a bottle of champagne! Israel was our chauffeur and he was AWESOME! We didn’t talk to him much towards our first two wineries, but he hung out for the third winery where we asked him “carne asada fries?” and he knew exactly where to go! We all ate, some slept, and the ride everywhere was smooth sailing!! This was all of our first time wine tasting and we had such an AMAZING time!! EDDIE definitely takes care of his customers and I would for sure book/recommend Masterpiece again for any other events!! THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!”",
