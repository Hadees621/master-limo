      "One of the most difficult problems to deal with when attending SDCC is the parking. If you managed to snag a hotel room, the costs of daily parking can be pretty high. If you weren’t able to find a room near Downtown San Diego, then your best bet is parking miles away and taking the local train. If you’re an annual Comic Con attendee, you most likely know the struggle of waking up early enough to catch the train and make it to the convention on time to explore the floor or see that panel you’ve been dying to attend. If you’re a cosplayer, then the struggle is definitely ten times more, at least!",
